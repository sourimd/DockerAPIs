app.py file contains a collection of most frequently used Docker APIs. I have used
docker-py package and Python Bottle framework for doing so. These packages can be
installed by issuing the following commands from the terminal

sudo pip install docker-py
sudo apt-get install python-bottle

These APIs are the most commonly used ones. Depending upon the business requirements
similar APIs can be created. Stay tuned for new APIs.
